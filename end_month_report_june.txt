   - Implement error handling and debugging to identify the root cause of the redirection issue.

3. **Code Changes:**

   **login.php**
   ```php
   <?php
   session_start();
   include('functions.php');

   if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
       $email = $_POST['email'];
       $password = $_POST['password'];

       if (loginAdmin($email, $password)) {
           $_SESSION['admin_logged_in'] = true;
           header('Location: dashboard.php');
           exit();
       } else {
           $error_message = "Invalid email or password.";
       }
   }
   ?>
   ```

   **functions.php**
   ```php
   <?php
   function loginAdmin($email, $password) {
       global $conn;
       $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM admins WHERE email = ?");
       $stmt->bind_param('s', $email);
       $stmt->execute();
       $result = $stmt->get_result();
       $user = $result->fetch_assoc();

       if ($user && password_verify($password, $user['password'])) {
           return true;
       } else {
           return false;
       }
   }
   ?>
   ```

4. **Testing:**
